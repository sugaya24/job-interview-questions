This is an application built in Next.js that allows you to post questions and get answers. I used rich text editor framework named Lexical made by Facebook. It also has a search function, and is a simple CRUD application with the features you would expect to find in a simple CRUD application with the added functionality needed in a commonly found application.
You can also register users using firebase auth. The profile image is stored using Amazon S3 to store the object.
